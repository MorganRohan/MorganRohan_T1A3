## App Overview
This app is designed to be a book review and recommendation platform, so that the user can record their own reviews of books they've read, access the reviews again and get recommendations. Reviews can be viewed again and sorted, or put into a file to download and print. A quiz can be taken to get a book recommendation, with the answer being added to a "To Be Read" List. 

## Scope
The scope of the application is in three parts, as follows:

1. The review section, which allows the user to input their own review of a book and have that stored against the title to be accessed again or printed at a later date.
- User inputs book title
- User can give a star rating out of 5
- User can write a review 

2. The recommendation section, which will be in the form of a quiz that the user can take to give a recommendation based on their interests. 
- User will be asked a series of multiple choice questions and will give their answer for each one
- These answers will be converted to points, with points being allocated towards each recommendation. The one with the most points will be printed as the recommendation
- User will be able to add this recommendation to a list: "To Be Read"

## Target Audience
The target audience will be book lovers who like to like to review books they've read and get recommendations for new ones to read as well. It can be a way to keep track of what's been read and whether that was enjoyed. It would also appeal to a newer reader who is also after recommendations.
